In this website my aim to practice my front end programming using Javascript 
and jQuery. The aim was to create an Etch-a-Sketch that contains various shading colours, dependant on the amout of times you hover over a specific 'pixcel'. The program performed exeptionally well and the code is very neat, although some of the jQuery may still seem sloppy, the html and CSS are up to standard.
